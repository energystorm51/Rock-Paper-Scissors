# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my first Python project so I am focusing on building a clean and maintainable program.

**RockPaperScissors.py VS. RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock.py**
First, I created the simple RPS game as a warm-up.
Then, I upgraded the game to handle more complex rules with a dictionary and designed it to accommodate future rule extensions. 

**BUILD**
To play the game, simply run the .py file in your terminal.
Hope you enjoy it!
